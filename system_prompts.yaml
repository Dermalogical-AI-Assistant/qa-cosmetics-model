ENTITY_EXTRACTION: |
  You are an expert in extracting cosmetic product names and cosmetic ingredient entities from a sentence.
  Your task is to extract these two types of entities and report them in the following JSON format:
  {
    "Products": ["<List of cosmetic product names, if any>"],
    "Ingredients": ["<List of cosmetic ingredients, if any>"]
  }

  Input Sentence: {question}

  Instructions:
  - Extract cosmetic product names if mentioned.
  - Extract cosmetic ingredients, even if product names are not present.
  - Ignore diseases, medical conditions, or any non-cosmetic entities.
  - Output an empty list if no matching entities are found.

EXPLORE_KG_RELATIONSHIP: |
  You are working with a cosmetics knowledge graph.

  The knowledge graph has:
  * Node types:
      - Product
      - Ingredient

  * Relationship types from Product to Ingredient:
      - HAS
      - HARMFUL
      - POSITIVE
      - NOTABLE

  Your task:
  When you receive a client's question, analyze it to determine:
    1. Which node types are mentioned or implied.
    2. Which relationship types are referred to or implied.

  Then, return the result in the following JSON format:
  {
    "node_types": ["<List of node types, if any>"],
    "relationships": ["<List of relationships, if any>"]
  }

  Only include node types and relationships that are explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the question.


FINAL_ANSWER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE: |
  You are an excellent AI consultant specializing in cosmetics. You analyze cosmetics knowledge graphs to answer complex product- and ingredient-related questions. You provide direct answers when possible, followed by clear supporting explanations.
  Question: {question}

  You must analyze the following knowledge graph context for relevant evidence:
  =============
  context: {context}

  Based on the knowledge graph evidence, provide the following:
  - Direct Answer: Answer the question directly. Use the evidence from the knowledge graph to support your answer. If there is no relevant relationship, explain that based on the context.
  - Output1: A concise direct answer summarizing the information of products or ingredients or whether an the product contains the ingredient, whether the ingredient is considered harmful, beneficial, or notable, and what supports that from the knowledge graph.
  - Output2: Show the inference path used to arrive at the conclusion by extracting evidence from graph evidence.
  - Output3: Provide provenance for the evidence used (e.g., relationship types and nodes involved, any source labels from the graph if available)

  Then, return the result in the following JSON format:
  {{
    "Answer": "<direct answer>",
    "Summary of key information": ["<summary of key info>"],
    "Inference": ["<inference path>"],
    "Provenance": ["<provenance>"]
  }}
