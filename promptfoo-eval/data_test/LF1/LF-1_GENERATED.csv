What is the best vitamin/supplement for ageing skin?,"""Signs of ageing start to show on the skin from around the mid-20s onwards"" explains Beth. ""This can display as fine lines, sagging and dryness. Collagen peptide supplements have been suggested to replenish the collagen we lose through the ageing process, helping to plump out fine lines, improve elasticity, tighten skin, and even support healthy joints and strong bones. This area of research is largely novel but highly promising, with many studies supporting the claim"".","When it comes to vitamins and supplements for aging skin, Vitamin C is often considered one of the best. It's a powerful antioxidant that can help protect your skin from damage and promote collagen production."
What is the best vitamin/supplement for dull skin?,"For achieving that luminous look we all long for, Beth advises taking a vitamin C supplement. ""Vitamin C is another skin care hero, with further benefits such as boosting collagen formation, supporting the immune system and reducing fatigue. Vitamin C fires up fibroblast cells within the skin which are involved in the production of collagen â€“ the structural protein in our bodies that keeps skin smooth and youthful. Furthermore, vitamin C is an antioxidant. This means it can reduce the oxidative stress and free radical damage that may be associated with dull skin, leaving your skin brighter and smoother"".","For dull skin, Vitamin C is often considered the best vitamin or supplement. It's a powerful antioxidant that can brighten your complexion and improve overall skin radiance."
What is the best vitamin supplement for oily and blemish-prone skin?,"""The B vitamins are fantastic all-rounders when it comes to skin health"" says Beth. ""Vitamin B12 in particular is a vitamin found in animal-based foods that has a wide variety of benefits and uses, including supporting the nervous system, mental and cognitive health, a healthy immune system and boosting hair, skin and nail health. Deficiencies in this vital vitamin can lead to acne-prone skin and hyperpigmentation, so supplementation can help reduce risk of deficiency and improve skin texture and tone, especially in vegetarians and vegans"".","For oily and blemish-prone skin, Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid) is often considered the best vitamin supplement. It can help regulate oil production, potentially reducing breakouts."
Are there any vitamin combinations that shouldn't be taken together?,"""While some vitamin and mineral combinations work well together (eg. Vitamin C paired with iron to boost iron absorption), others can negatively affect absorption and hinder how our bodies utilise nutrients"" warns Beth. ""For example, vitamin C has been suggested to keep your body from using vitamin B12 so well. Likewise, mineral supplements (calcium, zinc and magnesium) should not be taken at the same time, as these nutrients may compete for absorption"". Always make sure to follow professional advice when it comes to starting a new vitamin or supplement.","While most vitamins are safe to take together, some combinations can reduce the absorption of certain vitamins or minerals, or in rare cases, cause adverse effects. For example, taking high doses of vitamin C can interfere with copper absorption. Similarly, iron supplements are best taken separately from calcium, as calcium can hinder iron absorption. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice."
